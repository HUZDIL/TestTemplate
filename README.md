My Pattern

I used the page object model to create this project. And I also used Behavior Driven Development method because BDD is end-userâ€™s approach perspective. 
Feature and Step Definition are the most important part  for BDD framework.
I stored web elements and methods related to that PAGE into its own JAVA CLASS.
I used this model because of , RE-USABILITY, EASY TO MAINTAIN, EASY TO MANAGE.
Page Object Model is not a framework, it is a design pattern.

P.S:There are many hard-coding parts in my solutions because of to save time for this task, 
but in real life i try to minimaze the hard-coding.
To minimaze hard-coding and to easy maintaing I use configuration.properties file.
